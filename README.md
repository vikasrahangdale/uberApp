## Socket.io Integration

This project uses Socket.io for real-time communication. The server is set up to handle connections and events. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the socket setup:

- The server initializes Socket.io with CORS support.
- Clients can connect and join specific rooms or channels.
- Events can be emitted and listened to for real-time updates.

### Example Code Snippet

```javascript
const socketIo = require('socket.io');

function initializeSocket(server) {
    const io = socketIo(server, {
        cors: {
            origin: 'http://localhost:3000',
            methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
        },
    });

    io.on('connection', (socket) => {
        console.log(`Client connected: ${socket.id}`);

        socket.on('join', async (data) => {
            // Handle join event
        });
    });
}
```
